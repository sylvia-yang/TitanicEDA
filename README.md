# TitanicEDA
This is a python EDA project of Titanic dataset.

In this project, I will be analyzing data associated with the tragic event of sinking Titanic. In particular, I will be interested in finding trends among the passengers who survived, and how they differ from the passengers who didn't survive.
I will use Python to do exploratory data analysis towards this dataset.
I got this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/dataÂ¶
